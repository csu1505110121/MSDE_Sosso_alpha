# MSDE_Sosso_alpha

The computational workflow used in <MSDE paper> is contained in the Jupyter Notebook: MSDE_Sosso_alpha.ipynb

An Anaconda environment file (generated on a machine running Linux Centos 7) listing the necessary dependencies can be
found in the ./PYTHON directory as MSDE_Sosso_alpha.yml. The following additional packages can be installed  via pip:
- tensorflow
- keras
- mendeleev
- gpy

The latest (as of August 2019) version of pandas (pandas-0.24.2) is also needed, e.g.
pip install --upgrade pandas
